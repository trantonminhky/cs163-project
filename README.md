# cs163-project
For the CS163 - Data Structures course, me and my team (ARR-CHEESE) developed a Data Structures Visualizer. As the name suggests, it visualizes a myriad of data structures including linked list, graphs, AVL tree and hash table. This repository consists of the implementation and a report (which also contains a demonstration video).
